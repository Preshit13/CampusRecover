## Features

### Lost Items Management (Preshit Pimple)

- ✅ Report lost items with detailed descriptions, location, and contact info
- ✅ Search and filter lost items by category and location
- ✅ Edit lost item reports to update details
- ✅ Mark items as recovered when found
- ✅ Delete lost item reports
- ✅ Smart sorting: Active items first (newest to oldest), then recovered items
- ✅ Date validation: Cannot report items lost in the future

### Analytics Dashboard (Preshit Pimple)

- ✅ Overall recovery statistics (total lost, recovered, active, recovery rate)
- ✅ Top 5 most common loss locations with visual bars
- ✅ Most frequently lost item categories
- ✅ Recovery rate breakdown by category with progress visualization
- ✅ Real-time data aggregation using MongoDB pipelines

### Found Items Management (Gurudatt Gaonkar)

- ✅ Report found items with description, location found, current holding location, and contact info
- ✅ Search and filter found items by category and location
- ✅ Edit found item reports to update details or pickup location
- ✅ Mark items as claimed when returned to owner
- ✅ Delete found item reports
- ✅ Smart sorting: Unclaimed items first (newest to oldest), then claimed items
- ✅ Date validation: Cannot report items found in the future

### Smart Matching System (Gurudatt Gaonkar)

- ✅ Automatic match suggestions when viewing a found item
- ✅ Scoring algorithm based on category (40pts), location proximity (30pts), date proximity (20pts), and keyword similarity (10pts)
- ✅ Match confidence display: High (≥70%), Medium (≥40%), Low (<40%)
- ✅ Human-readable match reasons explaining why items are matched
- ✅ Only matches against active (unrecovered) lost item reports
- ✅ Top 5 matches returned per found item

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js

\`\`\`

### 2. Install Dependencies

\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

### 3. Environment Setup

Create a \`.env\` file in the root directory:

\`\`\`env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=3000
\`\`\`

**Note:** See \`.env.example\` for template. Never commit your \`.env\` file!

### 4. Seed Database (Optional)

To populate the database with 1000+ sample records:

\`\`\`bash
npm run seed
\`\`\`

### 5. Run the Application
